This release adds automatic rebuilding of the site when changes are made (OSX
only, so far). We're now using Mojo::Log for logging (instead of a hacked up
`diag()` sub).

A breaking change to applications: The `index()` method is no longer used by
the site to determine what is the front page of the app, appropriate to
transform into the front page of the site. Now, the first item returned by
`pages()` must be the index page. This reduces the number of methods
applications need, and made it easier to implement the automatic rebuilding.

Finally, some much-needed cleanup as part of the automatic rebuilding feature.
Still plenty of cleanup to go.
