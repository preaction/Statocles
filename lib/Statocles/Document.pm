=attr path

The path to this document. This is not settable from the frontmatter.

=cut

has path => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => PagePath,
    coerce => PagePath->coercion,
);

=attr store

The Store this document comes from. This is not settable from the
frontmatter.

=attr title

    ---
    title: My First Post
    ---

The title of this document. Used in the template and the main page
title. Any unsafe characters in the title (C<E<lt>>, C<E<gt>>, C<">, and
C<&>) will be escaped by the template, so no HTML allowed.

=cut

=attr author

    ---
    author: preaction <doug@example.com>
    ---

The author of this document. Optional. Either a simple string containing
the author's name and optionally, in E<gt>E<lt>, the author's e-mail address,
or a hashref of L<Statocles::Person attributes|Statocles::Person/ATTRIBUTES>.

=cut

sub _build_author { }

=attr status

The publishing status of this document.  Optional. Statocles apps can
examine this to determine whether to turn a document into a page.  The
default value is C<published>; other reasonable values could include
C<draft> or C<private>.

=cut

has status => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Str,

=attr content

tags.

=cut

    isa => ArrayRef,
    default => sub { [] },
    coerce => sub {

images in appropriate templates. Each image has a category, like C<title>,
C<banner>, or C<thumbnail>, mapped to an L<image object|Statocles::Image>.
See the L<Statocles::Image|Statocles::Image> documentation for a full

=attr date

    ---
    date: 2015-03-27
    date: 2015-03-27 12:04:00
    ---

The date/time this document is for. For pages, this is the last modified date.
For blog posts, this is the post's date.

Should be in C<YYYY-MM-DD> or C<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS> format.

=cut

has date => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => DateTimeObj,
    coerce => DateTimeObj->coercion,
    predicate => 'has_date',
);

=attr template

    ---
    template: /blog/recipe.html
    ---

The path to a template override for this document. If set, the L<document
page|Statocles::Page::Document> will use this instead of the template provided
by the application.

The template path should not have the final extention (by default C<.ep>).
Different template parsers will have different extentions.

=cut

has template => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Maybe[ArrayRef[Str]],
    coerce => sub {
        return $_[0] if ref $_[0];
        return [ grep { $_ ne '' } split m{/}, $_[0] ];
    },
    predicate => 'has_template',
);

=attr layout

    ---
    layout: /site/layout-dark.html
    ---

The path to a layout template override for this document. If set, the L<document
page|Statocles::Page::Document> will use this instead of the layout provided
by the application.

The template path should not have the final extention (by default C<.ep>).
Different template parsers will have different extentions.

=cut

has layout => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Maybe[ArrayRef[Str]],
    coerce => sub {
        return $_[0] if ref $_[0];
        return [ grep { $_ ne '' } split m{/}, $_[0] ];
    },
    predicate => 'has_layout',
);

=attr data

    ---
    data:
      ingredients:
        - Eggs
        - Milk
        - Cheese
    ---
    % for my $item ( @{ $self->data->{ingredients} } ) {
        <%= $item %>
    % }

A hash of extra data to attach to this document. This is available
immediately in the document content, and later in the page template.

Every document's content is parsed as a template. The C<data> attribute can be
used in the template to allow for some structured data that would be cumbersome
to have to mark up time and again.

=cut

has data => (
    is => 'rw',
);

=attr disable_content_template

    ---
    disable_content_template: true
    ---

This disables processing the content as a template. This can speed up processing
when the content is not using template directives. 

This can be also set in the application
(L<Statocles::Role::App/disable_content_template>), or for the entire site
(L<Statocles::Site/disable_content_template>).

=cut

has disable_content_template => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => Bool,
    lazy => 1,
    default => 0,
    predicate => 'has_disable_content_template',
);

    my ( $orig, $self, @args ) = @_;
    my $args = $self->$orig( @args );
    if ( defined $args->{data} && ref $args->{data} ne 'HASH' ) {
        derp qq{Invalid data attribute in document "%s". Data attributes that are not hashes are deprecated and will be removed in v2.0. Please use a hash instead.},
            $args->{path};

=method parse_content

    my $doc = $class->parse_content(
        path => $path,
        store => $store,
        content => $content,
    );

Construct a document the given content, with the given additional
attributes. Returns a new C<Statocles::Document> object.

This parses the YAML or JSON frontmatter into the document's attributes,
putting the rest of the file after the YAML or JSON frontmatter in the
C<content> attribute.

Custom document classes can override this method to change how file content is
parsed.

=cut

sub parse_content {
    my ( $class, %args ) = @_;

    my %doc;

}

=method deparse_content

    my $content = $doc->deparse_content;

Deparse the document into a string ready to be stored in a file. This will
serialize the document attributes into YAML frontmatter, and place the content
after.

=cut

sub deparse_content {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    my %data = %$self;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Statocles::Document is the base unit of content in Statocles.
L<Applications|Statocles::Role::App> take documents to build
L<pages|Statocles::Role::Page>.

Documents are usually written as files, with the L<content|/content> in Markdown,
and the other attributes as frontmatter, a block of YAML at the top of the file.

An example file with frontmatter looks like:

    ---
    title: My Blog Post
    author: preaction
    links:
        stylesheet:
            - href: /theme/css/extra.css

    In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some
