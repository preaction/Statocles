=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE:> This application's functionality has been added to
L<Statocles::App::Basic>. You can use the Basic app to replace this app. This
class will be removed with v2.0. See L<Statocles::Help::Upgrading>.

This L<Statocles::Role::App|Statocles::Role::App> manages static content with no processing,
perfect for images, stylesheets, scripts, or already-built HTML.
