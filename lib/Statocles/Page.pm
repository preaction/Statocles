=attr site

The site this page is part of.

=cut

has site => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => InstanceOf['Statocles::Site'],
    lazy => 1,
    default => sub { $Statocles::SITE },
);

=attr app

The application this page came from, so we can give it to the templates.

=cut

has app => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => ConsumerOf['Statocles::App'],
);

=attr path

The absolute URL path to save this page to.

=cut

has path => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Path,
    coerce => Path->coercion,
    required => 1,
);

=attr title

The title of the page. Any unsafe characters in the title (C<E<lt>>,
C<E<gt>>, C<">, and C<&>) will be escaped by the template, so no HTML
allowed.

=cut

has title => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Str,
    default => '',
);

=attr type

The MIME type of this page. By default, will use the L<path's|/path> file extension
to detect a likely type.

=cut

our %TYPES = (
    # text
    html => 'text/html',
    markdown => 'text/markdown',
    css => 'text/css',

    # image
    jpg => 'image/jpeg',
    jpeg => 'image/jpeg',
    png => 'image/png',
    gif => 'image/gif',

    # application
    rss => 'application/rss+xml',
    atom => 'application/atom+xml',
    js => 'application/javascript',
    json => 'application/json',
);

has type => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => Str,
    lazy => 1,
    default => sub {
        my ( $self ) = @_;
        my ( $ext ) = $self->path =~ /[.]([^.]+)$/;
        return $TYPES{ $ext };
    },
);

=attr date

The date of this page. Used for last updated date and blog post dates.

=cut

    default => sub { Time::Piece->new },
);

=attr data

A hash of additional template variables for this page.

=cut

has data => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => HashRef,
    default => sub { {} },
);

=attr links

A hash of arrays of links to pages related to this page. Possible keys:

    feed        - Feed pages related to this page
    alternate   - Alternate versions of this page posted to other sites

Each item in the array is a L<link object|Statocles::Link>. The most common
attributes are:

    text        - The text of the link
    href        - The page for the link
    type        - The MIME type of the link, optional

=cut

has _links => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => LinkHash,
    lazy => 1,
    default => sub { +{} },
    coercion => LinkHash->coercion,
    init_arg => 'links',
);

=attr images

A hash of images related to this page. Each value should be an L<image
object|Statocles::Image>.  These are used by themes to show images next
to articles, thumbnails, and/or shortcut icons.

=cut

has _images => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => HashRef[InstanceOf['Statocles::Image']],
    lazy => 1,
    default => sub { +{} },
    init_arg => 'images',
);

=attr markdown

The markdown object to render document Markdown. Defaults to L<the markdown
attribute from the Site object|Statocles::Site/markdown>.

Any object with a "markdown" method will work.

=cut

has markdown => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => HasMethods['markdown'],
    default => sub { $_[0]->site->markdown },
);

=attr template

The main L<template|Statocles::Template> for this page. The result will be
wrapped in the L<layout template|/layout>.

=cut

my @template_attrs = (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => InstanceOf['Statocles::Template'],
    coerce => Statocles::Template->coercion,
    default => sub {
        Statocles::Template->new( content => '<%= content %>' ),
    },
);

has template => @template_attrs;

=attr layout

The layout L<template|Statocles::Template> for this page, which will wrap the content generated by the
L<template|/template>.

=cut

has layout => @template_attrs;

=attr search_change_frequency

How frequently a search engine should check this page for changes. This is used
in the L<sitemap.xml|http://www.sitemaps.org> to give hints to search engines.

Should be one of:

    always
    hourly
    daily
    weekly
    monthly
    yearly
    never

Defaults to C<weekly>.

B<NOTE:> This is only a hint to search engines, not a command. Pages marked C<hourly>
may be checked less often, and pages marked C<never> may still be checked once in a
while. C<never> is mainly used for archived pages or permanent links.

=cut

has search_change_frequency => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Enum[qw( always hourly daily weekly monthly yearly never )],
    default => sub { 'weekly' },
);

=attr search_priority

How high should this page rank in search results compared to similar pages on
this site?  This is used in the L<sitemap.xml|http://www.sitemaps.org> to rank
individual, full pages more highly than aggregate, list pages.

Value should be between C<0.0> and C<1.0>. The default is C<0.5>.

This is only used to decide which pages are more important for the search
engine to crawl, and which pages within your site should be given to users. It
does not improve your rankings compared to other sites. See L<the sitemap
protocol|http://sitemaps.org> for details.

=cut

has search_priority => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Num,
    default => sub { 0.5 },
);

# _rendered_html
#
# The HTML rendered from the page. Cached.

has _rendered_html => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Str,
    predicate => '_has_rendered_html',
);

=method vars

    my %vars = $page->vars;

Get extra template variables for this page

=cut

    my ( $self ) = @_;
    return (

        site => $self->site,
        self => $self,
    );
}

=method render

    my $html = $page->render( %vars );

Render the page, using the L<template|Statocles::Page/template> and wrapping
with the L<layout|Statocles::Page/layout>. Give any extra C<%vars> to the
template, layout, and page C<content> method (if applicable).

The result of this method is cached.

=cut

sub render {
    my ( $self, %args ) = @_;

    return $self->_rendered_html if $self->_has_rendered_html;

    my %vars = (
        %{ $self->data },
        %args,
        $self->vars,
    );

    my $content = $self->template->render(
        # XXX: This is suboptimal. Isn't vars() enough?
        ( $self->can( 'content' ) ? ( content => $self->content( %vars ) ) : () ),
        %vars,
    );

    my $html = $self->layout->render(

=method links

    my @links = $page->links( $key );
    my $link = $page->links( $key );
    $page->links( $key => $add_link );

Get or append to the links set for the given key. See L<the links
attribute|/links> for some commonly-used keys.

If only one argument is given, returns a list of L<link
objects|Statocles::Link>. In scalar context, returns the first link in
the list.

If two arguments are given, append the new link to the given key.
C<$add_link> may be a URL string, a hash reference of L<link
attributes|Statocles::Link/ATTRIBUTES>, or a L<Statocles::Link
object|Statocles::Link>. When adding links, nothing is returned.

=cut

sub links {
    my ( $self, $name, $add_link ) = @_;
    if ( $add_link ) {
        push @{ $self->_links->{ $name } }, Link->coerce( $add_link );
        return;
    }
    my @links = uniq_by { $_->href }
        $self->_links->{ $name } ? @{ $self->_links->{ $name } } : ();
    return wantarray ? @links : $links[0];
}

=method images

    my $image = $page->images( $key );

Get the images for the given key. See L<the images attribute|/images> for some
commonly-used keys. Returns an L<image object|Statocles::Image>.

=cut

sub images {
    my ( $self, $name ) = @_;
    # This exists here as a placeholder in case we ever need to handle
    # arrays of images, which I anticipate will happen when we build
    # image galleries or want to be able to pick a single random image
    # from an array.
    return $self->_images->{ $name };
}

=method basename

    my $name = $page->basename;

Get the base file name of this page. Everything after the last C</>.

Get the full directory to this page. Anything that isn't part of L</basename>.

There will not be a trailing slash unless it is the root directory.
