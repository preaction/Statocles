0.093     2018-03-30 17:29:15-05:00 America/Chicago

    [BREAKING CHANGES]

    - Fixed deploy objects failing to find necessary content during
      deploy. When deploying a site, we need to copy the entire site to
      a temporary directory first, because the deploy might lose access
      to the templates and other source files (if, for example, the site
      is deployed to a different git branch).

      This means the deploy API has changed again to take a path, not
      a list of pages. The deploy copies all the files from the path and
      then does what it needs.

0.092     2018-03-29 22:51:16-05:00 America/Chicago

    *** This version is broken, do not use ***

    [BREAKING CHANGES]

    - The API for deploy objects has changed. They now accept an
      arrayref of pages, not a store object to copy. This is an attempt
      to reduce the amount of filesystem operations Statocles needs to
      do during deploy (formerly it was once to build the site, then
      copy the whole site to the deploy).

    - The `build` and `deploy` methods of the Site object have been
      removed. The code to build and deploy a site has been moved to the
      Statocles::Command::build and Statocles::Command::deploy
      respectively. Site objects now have a `pages` method to get all
      the pages for the site.

    [Added]

    - Added new Statocles::Command system. The Statocles class is now
      the main entry point for the command-line application, which
      delegates to Statocles::Command subclasses. This makes building
      custom commands possible.

0.091     2018-03-27 16:51:32-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed test failures when STDIN was attached to /dev/null during
      testing. Thanks @mohawk2!
    - Fixed test failures writing to site status file before
      `.statocles` directory is created

0.090     2018-03-26 12:06:38-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed test failure with misspelled module name. Thanks @mohawk2!
      [Github #560]
    - Increased requirement on Test::Exception to hopefully stop some
      test failures.

0.089     2018-03-25 18:56:42-05:00 America/Chicago

    [BREAKING CHANGES]

    - Page objects now use Mojo::Path objects to define their paths.
      This fixes problems that prevented Statocles from working on
      Windows. Thanks @mohawk2!

    - Most Statocles::Store methods have been removed in favor of
      a single iterator that returns objects (either Statocles::Document
      objects for known Markdown files, or Statocles::File objects for
      all other files).

      This makes it easier to mock a Store for testing and to, in the
      future, allow for different document types.

    - We've removed the ability to define the `class` metadata in
      documents. This may be replaced with a map of file extension to
      document class in a later release.

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed multiple bugs and test failures on Windows. Thanks @mohawk2!
    - Slightly improved test performance by testing page objects without
      rendering HTML


0.088     2018-03-19 14:28:40-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added next_page/prev_page attributes to list pages. These provide
      better access to the page data like title to make better links for
      users. The existing next/prev attributes only held paths, which
      made finding this information more difficult. Thanks @jberger!
      [Github #555]
    - Allow Link trees in navigations to support multi-level
      navigations. Thanks @jberger! [Github #553]

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed anchor-only links on the index page being rewritten to point
      to the wrong page. Thanks @jberger! [Github #554]
    - Moved some common attributes into a role to fix API differences
      between Document objects and Page objects. There is a lot more
      cleanup to be done in this regard, and we'll be doing that before
      pushing out v1.00.
    - Fixed problems running the user's editor when there are spaces in
      the path. Thanks @mohawk2! [Github #557]
    - Fixed some test failures with running the user's editor on Windows
      systems. Thanks @mohawk2! [Github #557]
    - Removed some useless editor error states that were causing
      spurious test failures for no good reason.

0.087     2017-11-28 14:43:46-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added "blank" layout templates to the default and bootstrap
      themes. These templates have no adornment whatsoever, and are
      ideal for things like slide decks and pop-up windows.

    - Added 'diagram' plugin to generate diagrams from Mermaid,
      a JS-based diagram system (https://mermaidjs.github.io/). Thanks
      @kiwiroy! [Github #525]

    - Added syntax highlighting to code sections in the Perldoc
      application. Thanks @kiwiroy!

0.086     2017-09-13 22:22:32-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added `disable_content_template` attribute to document,
      application, and site objects. This allows a site to disable
      content template processing (in the rare case where the template
      processing is confused by the content).

0.085     2017-09-08 02:25:01-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added the "dom" attribute to Statocles::Page. This caches the
      parsed HTML for the multiple transformations that must be
      performed. Hopefully this will speed up performance a little bit.

    - Added JSON frontmatter support. Now if the first character of
      a document is a `{`, the frontmatter will be treated as JSON. JSON
      can be a single line (the `}` end bracket must be at the end of
      the line) or multiple lines (the `}` end bracket must be on a line
      by itself).

0.084     2017-08-09 12:00:17-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - The Store object now has a "files" method which gets the iterator
      over all the files in the store. This can then be easily
      overridden to get the list of files from another place: The
      configuration file, a manifest file, a database, or what-have-you.

      Thanks @djerius for the patch!

0.083     2017-01-31 16:44:17-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - The new `statocles status` command shows you a quick status of
      your site, including the last time it was deployed and what date
      it was deployed up to (if different from the last date it was
      deployed). We will be adding more things to this later, so let us
      know if there are any statistics you'd like to know about your
      site! Thanks @perlancar [Github #516]

    - The `include` helper now accepts a `-raw` flag to disable the
      template renderer. This allows you to easily include Perl code and
      not have it mistaken for a template. Thanks justinQuiring on IRC
      for the bug report [Github #529]

      This isn't the end of this: We will likely fix the heuristics to
      ignore file types (extensions) that do not look like templates.
      This will be a breaking change, sorry.

0.082     2017-01-18 23:17:36-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - The `highlight` plugin now accepts a `-style` option to override
      what stylesheet is used for the current highlighting block. This
      makes it easier for me to demonstrate the various highlighting
      stylesheets we have available in the documentation.

    - The new documentation is released on
      http://preaction.me/statocles/docs. They are not yet
      fully-complete, but they are a lot friendlier than the previous
      docs (which are at http://preaction.me/statocles/pod).

    [Fixed]

    - The `HTMLLint` plugin now appropriately adds the filename to every
      single lint message. It also uses the HTML::Lint API correctly to
      avoid any future warnings about using it incorrectly. Thanks
      @petdance for explaining the proper use of the API.

0.081     2016-10-26 23:17:58-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Blog posts now have "Older" and "Newer" links so a reader can read
      a blog from start to finish, navigating through blog posts without
      having to return to the index page. Thanks @kbucheli! [Github
      #517]

      This is a theme change, so you will need to update your theme to
      see the older/newer links. See the Statocles default themes for
      examples.

0.080     2016-10-20 15:11:57-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Blog slugs (folder path) are now a bit neater: Apostriphes do not
      turn into dashes, and leading and trailing dashes are removed. So,
      where the blog post "It's good!" would have previously looked like
      "/2016/06/02/it-s-good-/", it will now look like
      "/2016/06/02/its-good/". Thanks @Ferki! [Github #507] [Github
      #508]

0.079     2016-10-14 20:49:24-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Other]

    - Now that Pod::Weaver 4.015 has shipped with fixes, recommend
      upgrading to 4.015 if the user has 4.014.

0.078     2016-10-12 14:30:18-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Multiple blog posts on the same day are now ordered by their
      `date` attribute. This makes the ordering predictable and
      changable, instead of being ordered alphabetically [Github #512].
      There will likely be some configuration additions here in the
      future to make the date formatting fit the blog's post frequency
      and groupings.

    [Other]

    - Ignore Pod::Weaver version 4.014. This version shipped with a bug
      that causes our tests to fail, likely causes weaving in the
      Perldoc app to throw a fatal error. You should downgrade to
      Pod::Weaver 4.013 (`cpanm Pod::Weaver 4.013`) or upgrade to
      Pod::Weaver 4.015 when that is released. [Github #513]
